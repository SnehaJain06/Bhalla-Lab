Modelling Nitric Oxide Signalling Pathways: All the files created during the summer internship period of (Jan-June 2023)
This repository contains the following:
1. Models: Two models were made during the project-
     a) NOS.json: HillTau model script for the abstracted NO signalling model
     b) NOS.py: MOOSE derived detailed mass-action and enzyme kinetics for NO signalling model
2. Experiments: Experiment files used as the data for determining the parameter involved in the model and optimisation developed in the FindSim format
3. Config Files: Files created to optimise the parameters in the models using the experiment files
