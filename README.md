Modelling Nitric Oxide Signalling Pathways: All the files created during the summer internship period
About the internship: It was a 6-month project (Jan-March online and May-June offline) under the mentorship of Prof. Upinder Singh Bhalla (NCBS), where I learnt to use the Python scripts and packages developed by the lab to model the role of Nitric Oxide in production and regulation of different signalling cascades responsible for various functions like neurogenesis, DNA damage repair and cell apoptosis.

This repository contains the following:
1. Models: Two models were made during the project-
     a) NOS.json: HillTau model script for the abstracted NO signalling model
     b) NOS.py: MOOSE derived detailed mass-action and enzyme kinetics for NO signalling model
2. Experiments: Experiment files used as the data for determining the parameter involved in the model and optimisation developed in the FindSim format
3. Config Files: Files created to optimise the parameters in the models using the experiment files in the HOSS Optimisation format
